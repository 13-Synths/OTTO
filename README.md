# TOP-1: **T**otally **O**riginal **P**roject-**1**

Ah, who doesnt love the [op-1](teenage.engineering/products/op-1)? Its a magical beast of modern technology! Everything you need to play around with electronic music, in one self-contained device. Its pretty close to perfect, but not quite - its simplicity is its power, but it's also the source of its shortcommings. And then of course, its not open source.

### Introducing the TOP-1!

To be fair, the TOP-1 is an op-1 clone. But i like to think it's a bit more than that. Some differences will be subtle, and some differences will be big. Especially the non-core modules will differ greatly, as most they are designed fully independently. The UI too varies, from the tapedeck, which is practically the same, to the metronome, which is very different (see both below)
